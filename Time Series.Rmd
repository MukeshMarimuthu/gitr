## R Markdown

In this Module we are going to analyse the data to find by what time we are getting more registration in facebook. 

```{r}
install.packages("xlsx",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

```{r}
library("xlsx")
rep=read.xlsx("fb.xlsx", sheetIndex= 1, header=TRUE, colIndex = c(1,2,3), startRow = 1, endRow = 185)
z=rep$Time
z
MyDatesTable <- table(cut(z, breaks="hour"))
MyDatesTable
data.frame(MyDatesTable)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
